#### Heading example

Setting Up Your Online Learning Environment.


As you consider your online learning environment, we have some tips and suggestions we have gathered from our customers and educational experts. Interested in what other districts have done?  Visit the SETDA eLearning district plans page, or Learning Keeps Going  for a resources directory.  Another great resource is Google’s Teach from Home resource hub and Microsoft EDU’s remote learning page. 

Keep Your Students on the Correct Web Sites

Sometimes it can be difficult to keep your students on websites that pertain to the class material they are learning. Vision’s web filter helps keep students on track by allowing teachers to choose what sites their students can visit and what sites they can’t.

Refocus Student Attention With a Click of the Button

When you add technology to the classroom, students tend to get distracted. The attention button allows you to quickly freeze your students’ screens, giving them a visual cue that you know they are off task. Re-direction is easier when students can’t use their computer.
