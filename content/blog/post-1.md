#### Heading example

Last spring, teachers from traditionally brick-and-mortar classrooms got a taste of remote teaching. Those experiences offered insight into new considerations in how classes must operate this fall. Here are some quick tips, as well as links to more in-depth resources, that can help ease the transition from classroom teaching to an online or hybrid teaching model.

##### Emphasis

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

##### Link
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

##### Paragraph

Teaching online is still teaching. Many of the same engagement theories from in-person teaching still apply online. Student-centered active learning online still includes real-world problem-solving opportunities, experimental methods that guide students toward a conclusion, and thinking and discussing learning activities.

Unfortunately, not all students and teachers will be working in optimal, distraction-free environments. So one of the most important things to remember about engagement this fall is that students, their families and teachers will all need a little extra grace as they cope with other worries and stressors.

Find new engagement indicators. Classroom teachers have traditionally been able to capture a quick measure of student engagement by just looking at their faces. Are they curious, interested or passionate about class activities? While you may still be able to measure engagement visually during video-oriented synchronous online sessions, classes this fall will have many more scenarios where this won’t be possible. Much of the work students will be doing won’t be on camera, so educators may need to find new indicators of engagement.

Here are a few engagement measures to consider: Are students logging on often? Are they submitting their work on time? Are they reacting to the learning in some way, by asking question and seeking additional resources? Are they responding to feedback and is their voice apparent in classroom forums and boards? These are all indicators of how well a student is connecting with class topics.

##### Code and Syntax Highlighting

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

##### Blockquote

##### Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

##### Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
